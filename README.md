# Data Science Portfolio

Welcome to this repository which shows all the projects completed by me for Academic, Self Learning and professional purposes. Please note that some of these are still under development and may not run smoothly. 

## Contents

- ### Machine Learning

	- [Machine Learning App](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/MachineLearning-app): A web application designed using Streamlit that trains a machine learning model (a Random forest classifier) on the uploaded dataset and makes predictions. Deployed on Heroku: https://ml-app27.herokuapp.com/  
	
	- [Deep Learning: Fashion image classification](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/fashion-image-classification/blob/main/fashion_image_classification.ipynb): A deep learning project with tensorflow to classify the clothing images using the Fashion MNIST dataset.
	
	- [Supervised Learning: Predicting stock movement using news headlines](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/stock-sentiment-analysis): Predicting the stock movement using the news headlines dataset downloaded from the kaggle repo: https://www.kaggle.com/aaron7sun/stocknews.
	
	- [Supervised Learning: Predicting the price of a used car](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/car-price-prediction): A supervised machine learning project that involves predicting the selling price of the used cars from the cardekho website dataset extracted from the kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho.
The project is deployed on heroku. Follow the link to check it out: https://carpred27.herokuapp.com/

	_Platform: Python, Heroku, Streamlit_ 

- ### Web Scraping in Python

	- [IMDB top 250 movies scraper](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/imdb-top-250-scraper): Scraping top 250 movies from the imdb webisite in python.
	
	- [Scraping related words from Wikipedia](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/scraping-related-words): Using python for web scraping the words related to a particular search word on wikipedia.

	_Tools: Pandas, BeautifulSoup and requests_

- ### R shiny Dashboards: 

	- [Covid-19 in Australia](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/covid-19-dashboard): A personal project aimed at visualising the covid-19 cases in Australia. It is an ongoing project and would probably feature an analysis on the economic impact of covid on Australia.

	- [Road Crashes in Victoria](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/Road-crashes-victoria-dashboard): A dashboard created in R-shiny dashboard to show a narrative visualisation of the road crashes in the state of Victoria since the past 5 years.
	
	- [Understanding Central Limit Theorem](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/central-limit-theorem): A demonstration of the central limit theorem (for sample means) in R shiny.
Follow the link to see the R shiny app: http://suvanshvaid27.shinyapps.io/central-limit-theorem/
	
	_Tools: R, R shiny dashboard_


- ### ML and Statistics in R: 

	- [Linear Regression tutorial](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/Simple-Linear-Regression-in-R): A demonstration of how to use simple linear regression in R using the toydataset.
Follow the link to check out the project: https://rpubs.com/SuvanshVaid27/simple-linear-regression

	- [K-means clustering tutorial on the iris dataset](https://github.com/SuvanshVaid27/K-Means-Clustering-in-R): A simple demonstration of k means clustering on the iris dataset.
Follow the link to check out the project: https://rpubs.com/SuvanshVaid27/k-means-clustering
